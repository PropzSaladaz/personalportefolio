                I´m 20 years, aspired by technology since a kid. I am <span> currently studying Computer Science </span>, finishing my 3rd Bachelor´s
                Degree at Instituto Superior Técnico, at Taguspark Campus. I have studied Mathmatics, Statistics, Algebra, Physics,
                Computer Organization, Operative Systems, Networks, Deep Learning, Computer Theory, Computer Organization, and some more
                subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                <span>I have worked with C, C++, Java, Javascript, Python, Prolog, HTML and CSS</span>. I have worked on some individual
                extra-curricular projects as well. Namely, I’ve started to work on a game with C++ using Unity engine (not finished yet)
                ....
                <br>
                <br>
                Besides Computer Science i also have other fiels i find amusing. Such as Philosophy, Psicology, Anatomy, and some other
                subjects.
                <br>
                <br>
                Pratically speaking, i have two great passions: Music and Photography. I am a violin player since my 6/7 years, and
                changed to viola about 5 years ago. I love playing it and love even more listening to some great classical compositions.

                    I also play piano (self learner for about one and a half years).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Besides playing, <span>i also compose</span>. This is probably my “Hidden Tallent” if i may say so. I started to dig into <span>music production</span> about 6 years ago. I started doing some intrumental beats for fun, for about 1/2 years, when i finally
                    stepped up, got a profetional program and started learning some more in depth concepts.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Today i have a 1.3k subscribers Youtube channel, where i post Trap, RnB, Dubstep, and some other musical genres.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Last year i also started to compose more elaborated music such as Classical piano compositions (I have 2 original
                    compositions so far, not publicly available) and Cinematic Orchestral compositions (I have 3 original compistions
                    inspired by some movies).
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Finally, my second passion - <span>Photography</span>. I started to get serious when i decided to step up and buy a full frame camera.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Since then i’ve taken this Hobbie quite seriously and have learned a lot of features about how the camera works, how to
                    configure the settings for a given scenario, and also how to frame de subject in the photo.
                    <br>
